# dotfiles

My personal OSX configuration, terminal config, utilities, etc.

# config.sh

Automatigically configure a new Mac in one command, out of the box, with no prerequisites.


Pulled a ton of stuff from my own research, but most of the OSX config comes from these two:

[Mathis Byens's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

[OSX for Hackers](https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465)

# Installation:

## READ the configure script before you attempt anything.

I don't take responsibility for anything that happens to your machine. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

## Customization

If for any reason you don't like what a line does, aren't sure what it will do, or otherwise have any concern, simply fork this repo and comment it out.

## To Install:

Simply copy and paste into Terminal. Sit back and enjoy.
